## Welcome & About FANzPLAY Fans!
  Welcome to the FANzPLAY Fans App! Our app is designed to allow fans of teams to play each other for sponsor rewards. Fans can sign up, log in, join games, play by answering questions, view available sponsor rewards, and change their profile details. Our final product was split into two apps, and the sister app to this is FANzPLAY Game Admin App. The repository for this app can be found under the [code tab](https://tarheels.live/teamn/code/) on our project website. 
  
  This project was made using Node.js and Javascript via React Native, and it is managed by ExpoGo. You can find more information about the structure and design of our app in our [design document](https://tarheels.live/teamn/deliverables/design-document/). 
  

## Running FANzPLAY Fans
  The .env file and Firebase authentification file have been removed from this app. This is done in order to prevent unknown parties from accessing or spamming our Firebase API Keys, which can lead to us being charged large amounts of money. 
  
  To run the app, you must create an .env in your clone of the repository. Don't worry though, we've left behind documentation on how to do this!

Cheers,
